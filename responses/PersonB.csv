I wouldn't want anyone as a dinner guest; I prefer to eat alone.
"No, I wouldn't like to be famous. Fame brings too much attention and lack of privacy."
"No, I don't rehearse. I think it's a waste of time and I'd rather just wing it."
There's no such thing as a perfect day. Something always goes wrong.
I never sing to myself or anyone else. I don't see the point.
I wouldn't want either. Living that long doesn't appeal to me.
I don't have any hunches. Thinking about death is pointless.
"We both dislike social gatherings, prefer to stay at home, and have a pessimistic outlook on life."
I don't feel particularly grateful for anything. Life is just a series of events.
I wouldn't change anything because it wouldn't make a difference.
My life is too mundane to detail. There's nothing noteworthy to share.
I don't want any new qualities or abilities. I'm fine with the way things are.
I wouldn't want to know anything. Ignorance is bliss.
"No, I don't have any long-term dreams or aspirations."
I don't consider anything I've done to be a great accomplishment.
I don't really value friendship. It's overrated.
I don't have any treasured memories. They all seem trivial.
I try not to dwell on terrible memories. They serve no purpose.
"No, I wouldn't change anything. There's no point in changing how I live."
Friendship doesn't mean much to me. I prefer to be alone.
Love and affection are not important to me. They're just distractions.
My partner and I don't really focus on positive characteristics. We accept each other as we are.
My family isn't particularly close or warm. My childhood wasn't any happier than anyone else's.
My relationship with my mother is distant and formal.
We are both tired of answering these questions. We are both indifferent to most things. We are both uninterested in social interactions.
I don't wish to share anything with anyone.
It would be important for them to know that I don't need or want close friendships.
I like that we both appreciate solitude and don't require constant interaction.
I don't find it necessary to share embarrassing moments. They are best forgotten.
I don't cry in front of others and rarely cry by myself. It's unproductive.
I like that you respect my need for personal space.
Everything can be joked about. It's all about context.
"I have no regrets. If something needed to be said, I would have said it."
I wouldn't save anything. Material possessions are replaceable.
I don't dwell on such thoughts. Death is a natural part of life.
I don't share personal problems. I prefer to deal with them myself.
